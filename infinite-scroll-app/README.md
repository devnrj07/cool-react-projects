# Code Challenge #16: Infinite Scroll Unsplash Gallery

Photos and media in general play a great part of websites and inefficient handling may lead to loss of site performance and ultimately, users. In this week's challenge, we will build a photo gallery which fetches random photos from Unsplash and displays them with an infinite scroll.

## The Challenge

In this challenge, you'll test your ability to utilize data from APIs as well as implementing an infinite scroll feature on a web page.

For this challenge, you are required to:

    Fetch random images from Unsplash using the Unsplash API.
    Display fetched images on the web page.
    Build an infinite scroll which fetches and displays more photos as you scroll to the end of the page.


### Tools used
- react
- free pics api
- Interaction Observer API
