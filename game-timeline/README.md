# Player Match TimeLine

This project is build to render long lists like match timelines, events and huge arrays of data. We are trying to render such a long list without dropping fps below 60.

Also, I plan to add filters to this as I've never done it before, so I'm gonna explore different strategies and options for filtering results.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
