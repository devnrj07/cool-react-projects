# Simple Shopping Cart (without state management lib)

I tried to build a shopping cart using the following stuff :
- React with Typescript
- Material UI
- Material UI Icons

We browse products, add items to cart and remove them from cart


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
